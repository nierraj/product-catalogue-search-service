# product-catalogue-search-service
It was asked in the Publicis Sapient Technical coding Round. 2 Hours were given and needed to code on their site(quizme) with Camera and Audio On. I write only 3 APIs during the test. Here, I am providing the complete product catalogue search service. 

## DB - H2
```
data.sql has Inserts which will populate Product table on Server Start up.

```

PUT - http://localhost:8080/products/catalogue  @ResponseBody(#ref Product)
DELETE - http://localhost:8080/products/catalogue/{productId}
```
